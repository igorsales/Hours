=== INTRODUCTION ===

This is a simple status bar widget written (mostly) in RubyCocoa to help keep track of time. 
It integrates with Google Calendar using the GCal4Ruby gem.

Once it's running, click the icon on the status bar to open the widget. Click the status bar icon
again to close it.

=== INSTALLATION ===


1) Install GCal4Ruby gem

http://cookingandcoding.com/gcal4ruby

% gem install gcal4ruby



2) Create Security framework BridgeSupport

source: http://bjeanes.com/2008/04/10/rubycocoa-and-keychain-access


If you run irb and obtain the result below

% irb
>> require 'osx/cocoa'
=> true
>> OSX.require_framework 'Security'
=> true
>> defined? OSX::SecKeychainAddGenericPassword
=> nil
>> defined? OSX::SecKeychainAddGenericPassword()
=> nil
>> exit

Then you need to generate the Security framework scripting bridge support for RubyCocoa

2.1) Generate the bridgesupport file

% gen_bridge_metadata -f Security -o Security.bridgesupport


2.2) Create the default folder where the scripting bridge support file will be found

% mkdir -p ~/Library/BridgeSupport


2.3) Move the file into its place

% mv Security.bridgesupport ~/Library/BridgeSupport/


2.4) Test again to ensure it's now properly picked up

% irb
>> require 'osx/cocoa'
=> true
>> OSX.require_framework 'Security'
=> true
>> defined? OSX::SecKeychainAddGenericPassword()
=> "method"
