*) Create Security framework BridgeSupport

source: http://bjeanes.com/2008/04/10/rubycocoa-and-keychain-access


If you run irb and obtain the result below

% irb
>> require 'osx/cocoa'
=> true
>> OSX.require_framework 'Security'
=> true
>> defined? OSX::SecKeychainAddGenericPassword
=> nil
>> defined? OSX::SecKeychainAddGenericPassword()
=> nil
>> exit

Then you need to generate the Security framework scripting bridge support for RubyCocoa

1) Generate the bridgesupport file

% gen_bridge_metadata -f Security -o Security.bridgesupport


2) Create the default folder where the scripting bridge support file will be found

% mkdir -p ~/Library/BridgeSupport


3) Move the file into its place

% mv Security.bridgesupport ~/Library/BridgeSupport/


4) Test again to ensure it's now properly picked up

% irb
>> require 'osx/cocoa'
=> true
>> OSX.require_framework 'Security'
=> true
>> defined? OSX::SecKeychainAddGenericPassword()
=> "method"
